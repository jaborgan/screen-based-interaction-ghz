# Notes & Response on reading by Gabriel Hernandez-Zepeda:

The tone of Norman’s writing conveys a sense of experience through trial and error as well as years spent working in ‘the industry’.
** From Preface: **
Norman comes from a background of a research scientist interested in principles of cognition.
•	Job at apple.
•	Most ‘human errors’ are really the fault of the initial designer.
•	Numerous examples of everyday interactions through the perspective of a design & cognition lens.
•	FEEDBACK – effects of an action, informative(ideally).
•	Constraints – limits on interaction or affect.
•	Affordances – perception that an action is possible.
“Design” umbrella term for architecture. Fashion. Landscapes. Objects. Experiences. 
Aesthetics vs. Cost
“making things that are understandable and usable”

Design of everyday objects,
ALSO applies to computers and other digital, or wireless devices…
Screen Based Interaction~~~

Human mind naturally made to make patterns and sense of the chaos in the world and in the universe.
On the topic of doors: reminds me of the early text – based dungeons and dragon’s games where you were presented with a verbal description on a room and you had the open-ended option to interact with the room.

Technological change: fast,
Human changes: slow.
•	Documented times that human societies have returned back to previous technological modes because it was deemed more efficient. (from Guns Germs & Steel)

** Affordance: ** perceived and actual properties of the thing.
-provides strong cues
“When simple things need pictures, labels, or instructions, the design has failed.” P.9

“When an action has no apparent result, you may conclude that the action was ineffective.” P.11

“…the difficulties of everyday life are amplified by the sheer profusion of items” p.12

“A good conceptual model allows us to predict the effects of our actions.” P.13
-Something about refrigerators.

Mappings ~ 
“Mappings are arbitrary: there is no rhyme or reason to the relationship between the actions the user must perform and the results to be accomplished. The controls have multiple functions.” P.22

“Natural mapping, by which I mean taking advantage of physical analogies and cultural standards, leads to immediate understanding.”




“The manufacturer wants something that can be produced economically. The store wants something that will be attractive to its customers. The purchaser has several demands.”

CD-Roms $$$.

Soft-drink machines.

Questions:
Are all humans designers to some extent? By either modifying or adapting to the natural world / environment?
