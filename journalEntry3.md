Visibility & Feedback

nothing succeeds like a good display

new microprocessors present powerful, intelligent systems possible for simple everyday objects.

barcode scanning - for price and discount information

sound feedback - clicks, snaps, clinks, beeps

keyboard sound when typing. could be muted, could be more clickedy-clack.

bell sounds
natural sounds, wooshes, metallic sounds, etc

absence of sound can also be a type of feedback (ie machine is not working)
too much sound can be distracting, even off putting (turn that thing off)

non-verbal cues (auditory)
