# Reading Discussion Response Ch 4.1 
## Don Norman’s Design of Everyday Things
### Gabriel Antonio Hernandez-Zepeda

•	Some devices that we expect to be simple can actually be very frustrating
•	Number of possibilities will influence the user’s expectation when using a new device
•	Use of design to signal appropriate actions

# Classification of constraints:
- physical limitations, more effective when made easy to see & interpret.
- Semantic constraints – rely on meaning of situation to control set of possible actions (rider of motorcycle must sit riding face forward (to see))
- Cultural constraints – signals are culturally understood (red means stop, green means go)(police vehicle has a blue light on top
“Cultural issues are at the root of many of the problems we have with new machines; there are as yet no accepted conventions or customs for dealing with them. “ p. 85
-	Knowledge structures dictate social constraints – following ‘scripts’
-	Consequences could be very uncomfortable, misunderstood, cause conflict or danger.
-Logical constraints – right switch operates right blinker, left switch operates left blinker.
